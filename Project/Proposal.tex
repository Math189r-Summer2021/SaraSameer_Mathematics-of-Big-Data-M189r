\section*{Project Description}
\smallskip
Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix â€” the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. Before the condition of cancer gets worsen, it is crucial to identify this problem and deal with its causes.Under-privileged areas, such as Pakistan, has lack of medical resources and expensive medical procedures. Most of the population is deprived of the screening test facility. Thus, I want to work on this project to present a productive approach towards testing the risk of cervical cancer among people.\\\\
\smallskip
In my project, I will analyse the likelihood of having cervical cancer by determining its predictors through Machine Learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Regression for prediction, Decision trees, Support Vector Machine etc. I aim to implement an algorithm that provides most accurate output to cope with this deadly disease.
